# Web Technologies Portfolio 
Task &amp; coursework

## 📖 Introduction
This repository documents the comprehensive progression of coursework for the **Web Technologies - Part A & B** module. It serves as a practical and theoretical archive demonstrating the end-to-end lifecycle of modern web development. The project explores the transformation of the internet from static information repositories to complex, dynamic ecosystems driven by sophisticated server-side logic and secure database interactions.

## 🛠️ Technological Scope
The coursework is structured across 10 intensive weeks, bridging the gap between client-side aesthetics and server-side functionality.

### 1. Frontend Architecture & Multimedia
The foundation of this project lies in **HTML5** and **Semantic Web** principles. Unlike legacy markup, this project emphasizes the use of semantic elements (`<header>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`) to enhance accessibility and SEO.  
Key implementations include:
- **Interactive Multimedia**: Native embedding of audio/video assets without third-party plugins.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizing **CSS3** and media queries to ensure fluid adaptability across mobile and desktop devices.
- **Client-Side Interactivity**: Implementing **JavaScript** and **AJAX** for asynchronous data loading and dynamic DOM manipulation, creating a seamless user experience.

### 2. Server-Side Logic & CMS
Moving beyond static pages, the repository explores the backend technologies that power dynamic applications.
- **Scripting Languages**: A comparative analysis and practical application of **PHP**, **ASP.NET**, and **JSP** to handle the Request-Response cycle.
- **Content Management**: An in-depth deployment of **WordPress**, demonstrating how CMS platforms democratize publishing through themes, plugins, and database-driven content organization.

### 3. Deployment & Infrastructure
A critical component of this portfolio is the establishment of professional development workflows.
- **Local Environments**: Configuration of local stacks using **WAMP/XAMPP** for safe testing.
- **Version Control**: Utilization of **Git** and **GitHub** for branching, merging, and collaborative code management.
- **Live Deployment**: Execution of **FTP** protocols using **FileZilla** to transfer assets from local directories to live public servers.

### 4. Security & User Management
The final phase addresses the ethical and technical responsibilities of handling user data.
- **Authentication**: Design of secure registration systems, emphasizing **password hashing/salting** over plain-text storage.
- **Vulnerability Defense**: Implementation of input sanitization and validation strategies to mitigate common threats such as **SQL Injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.
- **Access Control**: defining Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to differentiate between standard users and administrators.
