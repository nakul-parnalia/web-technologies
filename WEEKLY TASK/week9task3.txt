Admin privileges in a user management system grant special, high-level access rights that allow a user to manage the system and other users, rather than just their own profile. These privileges typically include the ability to create, delete, and modify user accounts, reset passwords for others, view sensitive system logs, and configure global settings that affect the entire application.

These privileges are critical because they ensure:

Security and Control: Admins can deactivate compromised accounts, enforce security policies (like password strength), and monitor logs for suspicious activity, acting as the "gatekeepers" of the system.

System Maintenance: Someone must have the authority to perform "housekeeping" tasks like deleting spam users, fixing configuration errors, or updating software without needing to access the database directly.

Support and Recovery: Admins provide a safety net for standard users, resolving issues like locked accounts or lost access that users cannot fix themselves.
​

Because they are so powerful, admin accounts are often targets for attackers and should be protected with extra security measures (like Multi-Factor Authentication) and limited to as few people as possible.
