I have reviewed the content from the W3Schools pages on HTML Multimedia. Here is a summary of the key concepts and tools for embedding diverse multimedia content into a website, based on those resources.

1. Key HTML Multimedia Tags
Modern HTML5 provides dedicated tags to embed media directly without needing plugins (like Flash, which is obsolete).

<video>: Used to embed video files (like movie clips or game highlights).

Controls: Adding the controls attribute gives the user play/pause buttons, volume, and a seek bar.

Source: You use <source> tags inside it to provide different file formats. The browser picks the first one it supports.

Best Format: MP4 is the recommended format because it is supported by all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox).

Example:

xml
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<audio>: Used to embed sound files (like music, podcasts, or sound effects).

Works very similarly to the video tag.

Best Format: MP3 is the standard choice for music and audio because of its balance between quality and file size, and universal support.

Example:

xml
<audio controls>
  <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<iframe>: Used to embed content from another website, such as a YouTube video, a Google Map, or a Spotify player.

This effectively opens a "window" to another site inside your page.

Example (YouTube):

xml
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"></iframe>
2. Supported File Formats
The browser can only play specific formats. If you use the wrong one (like .avi or .wmv), it won't play natively on the web page.

Media Type	Recommended (Universal)	Alternative (Open Source)	Avoid (Not Supported)
Video	MP4 (.mp4)	WebM (.webm), Ogg (.ogg)	AVI, WMV, MOV, Flash
Audio	MP3 (.mp3)	WAV (.wav), Ogg (.ogg)	WMA, MIDI, AAC (partial)
3. How to "Familiarise" Yourself (Practice Task)
To solidify this knowledge, try creating a simple "Media Gallery" page on your computer (or WAMP server):

Find Files: Locate an .mp4 video (short clip) and an .mp3 song on your computer.

Code: Create a file named media.html.

Embed:

Add a <video> tag for your MP4 file.

Add an <audio> tag for your MP3 file.

Add an <iframe> tag for a YouTube video (use the "Embed" code from any YouTube video).

Test: Open media.html in Chrome/Edge and see if you can play all three.

This covers the core concepts of embedding multimedia as presented in the W3Schools documentation.
